She has become as a widow, who was great among the nations! She who was a princess among the provinces has become a forced laborer!"},{"content":" She weeps bitterly in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; among all her lovers she has none to comfort her. All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they have become her enemies."},{"content":" Judah has gone into exile because of affliction and harsh servitude; she dwells among the nations, she finds no rest: all her persecutors overtook her in the midst of her distress."},{"content":" The roads to Zion mourn, because no one comes to the solemn assembly; all her gates are desolate, her priests groan: her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness."},{"content":" Her adversaries have become the head, her enemies prosper; for the LORD has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her young children have gone into captivity before the adversary."},{"content":" All majesty has departed from the daughter of Zion: her leaders have become like deer that find no pasture, they fled exhausted before the pursuer."},{"content":" Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and wandering all her precious things that were from the days of old: when her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and no one helped her. The adversaries saw her, they mocked at her desolations."},{"content":" Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she has become as an unclean thing; all who honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yes, she groans, and turns away."},{"content":" Her filthiness was in her skirts; she did not remember her latter end; therefore her fall was astonishing; she has no comforter. \"Look, LORD, on my affliction, for the enemy has magnified himself.\""},{"content":" The adversary has spread out his hand on all her precious things: for she has seen that the nations have entered into her sanctuary, concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly."},{"content":" All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their precious things for food to refresh the soul. \"Look, LORD, and see, for I am despised.\""},{"content":" Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which is brought on me, with which the LORD has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger."},{"content":" From on high he has sent fire into my bones, and it overcame them. He has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back. He has made me desolate and faint all the day."},{"content":" My transgressions are bound into a yoke; by his hand they are fastened together, they are set upon my neck; he has made my strength to fail. The Lord has delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand."},{"content":" The Lord has rejected all my mighty men in my midst; he has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men. The Lord has trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah."},{"content":" For these things I weep; my eyes, my eyes flow with tears; because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me. My children are desolate, because the enemy has prevailed."},{"content":" Zion spreads forth her hands; there is none to comfort her. The LORD has commanded concerning Jacob, that those who are around him should be his adversaries.

My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity."},{"content":" I called for my lovers, but they deceived me. My priests and my elders perished in the city, while they searched for food to refresh their souls."},{"content":" See, LORD, for I am in distress; my stomach churns; my heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled. Outside the sword bereaves, inside there is death."},{"content":" They have heard that I groan; there is none to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that you have done it. Bring the day that you have proclaimed, so that they shall end up like me."},{"content":" Let all their wickedness come before you. Do to them, as you have done to me for all my transgressions. For my groans are many, and my heart is faint."}],[{"content":" How the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger! He has cast down from heaven to the earth the splendor of Israel, and hasn't remembered his footstool in the day of his anger."},{"content":" The Lord has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and has not pitied. He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah. He has brought them down to the ground; he has humiliated the kingdom and its princes."},{"content":" He has cut off in fierce anger all the strength of Israel. He has drawn back his right hand before the enemy. He has blazed in Jacob like a flaming fire, which devours all around."},{"content":" He has bent his bow like an enemy; his right hand he has positioned like an adversary. He killed all that were pleasant to the eye. In the tent of the daughter of Zion he has poured out his wrath like fire."},{"content":" The Lord has become as an enemy; he has swallowed up Israel; he has swallowed up all her palaces and has destroyed its strongholds. He has multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation."},{"content":" He has done violence to his temple, as if it were a garden; he has destroyed his place of assembly. The LORD has caused solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion. He has spurned in his fierce anger the king and the priest."},{"content":" The Lord has rejected his altar, he has disowned his sanctuary, and has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces. They have made a shout in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn assembly."},{"content":" The LORD has determined to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion.

Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is no more, and her prophets find no vision from the LORD."},{"content":" The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground in silence. They have cast up dust on their heads; they have clothed themselves with sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground."},{"content":" My eyes are worn out from weeping, my stomach is churning. My heart is poured on the earth, because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, because the young children and the infants faint in the streets of the city."},{"content":" They tell their mothers, \"Where is grain and wine?\" When they faint as the wounded in the streets of the city, as their lives fade away in their mothers' bosom."},{"content":" What shall I testify of you? What shall I liken to you, daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I compare to you, that I may comfort you, virgin daughter of Zion? For your ruin is great like the sea. Who can heal you?"},{"content":" Your prophets have seen for you false and deceptive visions. They have not uncovered your iniquity, to bring back your captivity, but have seen for you false and misleading oracles."},{"content":" All that pass by clap their hands at you, they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, \"Is this the city that men called 'The perfection of beauty,' 'The joy of the whole earth'?\""},{"content":" All your enemies have opened wide their mouth against you. They hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, \"We have swallowed her up. Certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.\""},{"content":" The LORD has done that which he purposed, he has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old. He has thrown down, and has not pitied. He has caused the enemy to gloat over you and exalted the horn of your adversaries."},{"content":" Their heart cried to the Lord. O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night. Give yourself no respite; do not let your tears cease."},{"content":" Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches. Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord. Lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street."},{"content":" Look, LORD, and see to whom you have done like this! Shall the women eat their fruit, the children that are dandled in the hands? Shall the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?"},{"content":" The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets; my virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword. You have killed them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered, without pity."},{"content":" You have called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side.
