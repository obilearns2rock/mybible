If we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer."},{"content":"Our hope for you is steadfast, knowing that, since you are partakers of the sufferings, so also are you of the comfort."},{"content":"For we do not desire to have you uninformed, brothers, concerning our affliction which happened in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, so much that we despaired even of life."},{"content":"Yes, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,"},{"content":"who delivered us out of so great a death, and he will deliver us.

Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the \"Yes, yes\" and the \"No, no?\""},{"content":"But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not \"Yes and no.\""},{"content":"For the Son of God, Jesus Messiah, who was preached among you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not \"Yes and no,\" but in him is \"Yes.\""},{"content":"For however many are the promises of God, in him they are \"Yes.\" Therefore also through him they are \"Amen,\" to the glory of God through us."},{"content":"Now he who establishes us with you in Messiah, and anointed us, is God;"},{"content":"who also sealed us, and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts."},{"content":"But I call God for a witness to my soul, that I did not come to Corinth to spare you."},{"content":"Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are fellow workers with you for your joy. For you stand firm in faith."}],[{"content":"But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow."},{"content":"For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?"},{"content":"And I wrote this very thing, so that, when I came, I would not have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you."},{"content":"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you."},{"content":"But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all."},{"content":"Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;"},{"content":"so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow."},{"content":"Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him."},{"content":"For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things."},{"content":"Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything.

Or if we are of sober mind, it is for you."},{"content":"For the love of Messiah constrains us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore all died."},{"content":"He died for all, that those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again."},{"content":"Therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on. Even though we have known Messiah after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more."},{"content":"Therefore if anyone is in Messiah, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold, new things have come."},{"content":"But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Messiah, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;"},{"content":"namely, that God was in Messiah reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation."},{"content":"We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Messiah, as though God were entreating by us: we beg you on behalf of Messiah, be reconciled to God."},{"content":"For him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."}],[{"content":"Working together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain,"},{"content":"for he says, \"At an acceptable time I listened to you, in a day of salvation I helped you.\" Behold, now is the acceptable time.

Our heart is enlarged."},{"content":"You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections."},{"content":"Now in return, I speak as to my children, you also be open wide."},{"content":"Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?"},{"content":"What agreement has Messiah with Belial? Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?"},{"content":"What agreement has a temple of God with idols? For we are a temple of the living God.

We wronged no one. We corrupted no one. We took advantage of no one."},{"content":"I say this not to condemn you, for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die together and live together."},{"content":"Great is my boldness of speech toward you. Great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in all our affliction."},{"content":"For even when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side. Fightings were outside. Fear was inside."},{"content":"Nevertheless, he who comforts the lowly, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;"},{"content":"and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, while he told us of your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced still more."},{"content":"For though I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it. For I see that my letter made you sorry, though just for a while."},{"content":"I now rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly way, that you might suffer loss by us in nothing."},{"content":"For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, which brings no regret. But the sorrow of the world works death."},{"content":"For behold, this same thing, that you were made sorry in a godly way, what earnest care it worked in you. Yes, what defense, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the matter."},{"content":"So although I wrote to you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of God."},{"content":"Therefore we have been comforted. In our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all."},{"content":"For if in anything I have boasted to him on your behalf, I was not disappointed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth."},{"content":"His affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembers all of your obedience, how with fear and trembling you received him."},{"content":"I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you."}],[{"content":"Moreover, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia;"},{"content":"how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality."},{"content":"For according to their power, I testify, yes and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord,"},{"content":"begging us with much entreaty to receive this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints."},{"content":"This was not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God."},{"content":"So we urged Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace."},{"content":"But as you abound in everything, in faith, utterance, knowledge, all earnestness, and in the love from us that is in you, see that you also abound in this grace."},{"content":"I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love."},{"content":"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Messiah, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich."},{"content":"I give a judgment in this: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to start a year ago, not only to do, but also to be willing."},{"content":"But now complete the doing also, that as there was the readiness to be willing, so there may be the completion also out of your ability."},{"content":"For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you do not have."},{"content":"For this is not that others may be eased and you distressed,"},{"content":"but for equality. Your abundance at this present time supplies their lack, that their abundance also may become a supply for your lack; that there may be equality."},{"content":"As it is written, \"He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack.\""},{"content":"But thanks be to God, who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus."},{"content":"For he indeed accepted our exhortation, but being himself very earnest, he went out to you of his own accord."},{"content":"We have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known through all the churches."},{"content":"Not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our readiness."},{"content":"We are avoiding this, that any man should blame us concerning this abundance which is administered by us."},{"content":"Having regard for honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men."},{"content":"We have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you."},{"content":"As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they are the apostles of the churches, the glory of Messiah."},{"content":"Therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the churches, and of our boasting on your behalf."}],[{"content":"It is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints,"},{"content":"for I know your readiness, of which I boast on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared for a year past. Your zeal has stirred up very many of them."},{"content":"But I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect, that, just as I said, you may be prepared,"},{"content":"so that I won't by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) should be disappointed in this confidence."},{"content":"I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you, and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness."},{"content":"Remember this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully."},{"content":"Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart; not grudgingly, or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver."},{"content":"And God is able to make all grace abound to you, that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work."},{"content":"As it is written, \"He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor. His righteousness remains forever.\""},{"content":"Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, will supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;"},{"content":"you being enriched in everything to all liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God."},{"content":"For this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints, but abounds also through many thanksgivings to God;"},{"content":"seeing that through the proof given by this service, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Messiah, and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all;"},{"content":"while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you."},{"content":"Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!"}],[{"content":"Now I Paul, myself, entreat you by the humility and gentleness of Messiah; I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you."},{"content":"But I implore you that when I am present I may not have to be bold with the confidence with which I intend on showing against some, who consider us to be walking according to the flesh."},{"content":"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh;"},{"content":"for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty in God for the tearing down of strongholds,"},{"content":"throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Messiah;"},{"content":"and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience will be made full."},{"content":"Do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face? If anyone trusts in himself that he is Messiah's, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Messiah's, so also we are Messiah's."},{"content":"For though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority, (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down) I will not be disappointed,"},{"content":"that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters."},{"content":"For, \"His letters,\" they say, \"are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is despised.\""},{"content":"Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present."},{"content":"For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding."},{"content":"But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but within the boundaries with which God appointed to us, which reach even to you."},{"content":"For we do not stretch ourselves too much, as though we did not reach to you. For we came even as far as to you with the Good News of Messiah,"},{"content":"not boasting beyond proper limits in other men's labors, but having hope that as your faith grows, we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence,"},{"content":"so as to proclaim the Good News even to the parts beyond you, not to boast in what someone else has already done."},{"content":"But \"he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.\""},{"content":"For it is not he who commends himself who is approved, but whom the Lord commends."}],[{"content":"I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness, but indeed you do bear with me."},{"content":"For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy. For I married you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Messiah."},{"content":"But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness, so your minds might be corrupted from a sincere and pure devotion to Messiah."},{"content":"For if he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not proclaim, or if you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different \"good news\", which you did not accept, you put up with that well enough."},{"content":"For I reckon that I am not at all behind the very best apostles."},{"content":"Even though I am unskilled in speech, I am not unskilled in knowledge. But in every way we have made this known to you in all things."},{"content":"Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached to you God's Good News free of charge?"},{"content":"I robbed other churches, taking wages from them that I might serve you."},{"content":"When I was present with you and was in need, I was not a burden on anyone, for the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my need. In everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and I will continue to do so."},{"content":"As the truth of Messiah is in me, no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia."},{"content":"Why? Because I do not love you? God knows."},{"content":"But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion, that in which they boast, they may be found even as we."},{"content":"For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as Messiah's apostles."},{"content":"And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light."},{"content":"It is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works."},{"content":"I say again, let no one think me foolish. But if so, yet receive me as foolish, that I also may boast a little."},{"content":"That which I speak, I do not speak according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting."},{"content":"Seeing that many boast after the flesh, I will also boast."},{"content":"For you bear with the foolish gladly, being wise."},{"content":"For you bear with a man, if he brings you into bondage, if he devours you, if he takes you captive, if he exalts himself, if he strikes you on the face."},{"content":"I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet however any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also."},{"content":"Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I."},{"content":"Are they servants of Messiah? (I speak as one beside himself) I am more so; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths often."},{"content":"Five times from the Jews I received forty stripes minus one."},{"content":"Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I suffered shipwreck. I have been a night and a day in the deep."},{"content":"I have been in travels often, perils of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from my countrymen, perils from the Gentiles, perils in the city, perils in the wilderness, perils in the sea, perils among false brothers;"},{"content":"in labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, and in cold and nakedness."},{"content":"Besides those things that are outside, there is that which presses on me daily, anxiety for all the churches."},{"content":"Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I do not burn with indignation?"},{"content":"If I must boast, I will boast of the things that concern my weakness."},{"content":"The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed forevermore, knows that I do not lie."},{"content":"In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes to arrest me."},{"content":"Through a window I was let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands."}],[{"content":"It is necessary to boast, though it is not profitable. But I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord."},{"content":"I know a man in Messiah, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I do not know, or whether out of the body, I do not know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven."},{"content":"I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I do not know; God knows),"},{"content":"how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter."},{"content":"On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses."},{"content":"For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me, or hears from me."},{"content":"By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively."},{"content":"Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me."},{"content":"He has said to me, \"My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.\" Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Messiah may rest on me."},{"content":"Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Messiah's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong."},{"content":"I have become foolish. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing."},{"content":"Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty works."},{"content":"For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the churches, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong."},{"content":"Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not what is yours, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children."},{"content":"I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?"},{"content":"But be it so, I did not myself burden you. But, being crafty, I caught you with deception."},{"content":"Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you?"},{"content":"I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Did not we walk in the same spirit? Did not we walk in the same steps?"},{"content":"Have you been thinking all this time that we have been defending ourselves before you?
