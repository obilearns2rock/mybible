Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?"},{"content":"I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,"},{"content":"so that no one should say that you had been baptized into my own name."},{"content":"(I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I do not know whether I baptized any other.)"},{"content":"For Messiah sent me not to baptize, but to proclaim the Good Newsï¿½not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Messiah would not be made void."},{"content":"For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God."},{"content":"For it is written, \"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing.\""},{"content":"Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this world? Hasn't God made foolish the wisdom of this world?"},{"content":"For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not know God, it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe."},{"content":"For Jews ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,"},{"content":"but we preach Messiah crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,"},{"content":"but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Messiah is the power of God and the wisdom of God."},{"content":"Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men."},{"content":"For consider your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many powerful, and not many noble."},{"content":"But God chose the foolish of the world to shame the wise. And God chose the weak of the world to shame the strong."},{"content":"And God chose the lowly of the world, and the despised, what is considered to be nothing, to bring to nothing what is considered to be something,"},{"content":"that no flesh might boast before God."},{"content":"And because of him you are in Messiah Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,"},{"content":"so that, as it is written, \"Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.\""}],[{"content":"When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with superiority of speech or wisdom, proclaiming to you the mystery of God."},{"content":"For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Messiah, and him crucified."},{"content":"When I was with you, I was weak and afraid and I shook.

For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."},{"content":"But as it is written, No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has imagined the things which God has prepared for those who love him."},{"content":"But to us God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God."},{"content":"For who among men knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? So also, no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God."},{"content":"But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God."},{"content":"And we speak of these things, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things."},{"content":"Now the natural man does not receive the things of God's Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned."},{"content":"But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one."},{"content":"\"For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?\" But we have Messiah's mind."}],[{"content":"Brothers, I could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Messiah."},{"content":"I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren't yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,"},{"content":"for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, are you not fleshly, and do you not walk in the ways of men?"},{"content":"For when one says, \"I follow Paul,\" and another, \"I follow Apollos,\" are you not men?"},{"content":"Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?"},{"content":"I planted. Apollos watered.

You are God's farming, God's building."},{"content":"According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it.

If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise."},{"content":"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, \"He has taken the wise in their craftiness.\""},{"content":"And again, \"The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.\""},{"content":"Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,"},{"content":"whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,"},{"content":"and you are Messiah's, and Messiah is God's."}],[{"content":"So let a man think of us as Messiah's servants, and stewards of God's mysteries."},{"content":"Here, moreover, it is required of stewards, that they be found faithful."},{"content":"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by man's judgment. Yes, I do not judge my own self."},{"content":"For I know nothing against myself. Yet I am not justified by this, but he who judges me is the Lord."},{"content":"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each man will get his praise from God."},{"content":"Now these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us you might learn not to go beyond the things which are written, that none of you be puffed up against one another."},{"content":"For who makes you different? And what do you have that you did not receive? But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?"},{"content":"You are already filled. You have already become rich. You have come to reign without us. Yes, and I wish that you did reign, that we also might reign with you."},{"content":"For, I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death. For we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men."},{"content":"We are fools for Messiah's sake, but you are wise in Messiah. We are weak, but you are strong. You have honor, but we have dishonor."},{"content":"Even to this present hour we hunger, thirst, are naked, are beaten, and have no certain dwelling place."},{"content":"We toil, working with our own hands. When people curse us, we bless. Being persecuted, we endure."},{"content":"Being defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, the dirt wiped off by all, even until now."},{"content":"I do not write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children."},{"content":"For though you have ten thousand tutors in Messiah, yet not many fathers. For in Messiah Jesus, I became your father through the Good News."},{"content":"I beg you therefore, be imitators of me."},{"content":"Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Messiah, even as I teach everywhere in every church."},{"content":"Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you."},{"content":"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord is willing. And I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power."},{"content":"For the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power."},{"content":"What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?"}],[{"content":"It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even among the Gentiles, that one has his father's wife."},{"content":"You are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you."},{"content":"For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing."},{"content":"In the name of our Lord Jesus, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,"},{"content":"are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord."},{"content":"Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?"},{"content":"Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Messiah, our Passover, has been sacrificed."},{"content":"Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."},{"content":"I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;"},{"content":"yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world."},{"content":"But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. Do not even eat with such a person."},{"content":"For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside? Do you not judge those who are within?"},{"content":"But those who are outside, God judges. \"Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.\""}],[{"content":"Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?"},{"content":"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?"},{"content":"Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?"},{"content":"If then, you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the church?"},{"content":"I say this to move you to shame. Is not there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers?"},{"content":"But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers!"},{"content":"Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?"},{"content":"No, but you yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that against your brothers."},{"content":"Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor men who have sexual relations with men, "},{"content":"nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor swindlers, will inherit the Kingdom of God."},{"content":"Such were some of you, but you were washed. But you were sanctified. But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Messiah, and in the Spirit of our God."},{"content":"\"All things are lawful for me,\" but not all things are expedient. \"All things are lawful for me,\" but I will not be brought under the power of anything."},{"content":"\"Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods,\" but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body."},{"content":"Now God raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power."},{"content":"Do you not know that your bodies are members of Messiah? Shall I then take the members of Messiah, and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!"},{"content":"Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For, \"The two,\" says he, \"will become one flesh.\""},{"content":"But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."},{"content":"Flee sexual immorality! \"Every sin that a man does is outside the body,\" but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body."},{"content":"Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which you have from God? You are not your own,"},{"content":"for you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body."}],[{"content":"Now concerning the things about which you wrote: it is good for a man not to touch a woman."},{"content":"But, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband."},{"content":"Let the husband fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband."},{"content":"The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife."},{"content":"Do not deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to prayer, and may be together again, that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control."},{"content":"But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment."},{"content":"Yet I wish that all men were like me. However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind."},{"content":"But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am."},{"content":"But if they do not have self-control, let them marry. For it's better to marry than to burn."},{"content":"But to the married I commandï¿½not I, but the Lordï¿½that the wife not leave her husband"},{"content":"(but if she departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband not leave his wife."},{"content":"But to the rest Iï¿½not the Lordï¿½say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let him not leave her."},{"content":"The woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content to live with her, let her not leave her husband."},{"content":"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy."},{"content":"Yet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us to peace."},{"content":"For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?"},{"content":"Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk. So I command in all the churches."},{"content":"Was anyone called having been circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised."},{"content":"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."},{"content":"Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called."},{"content":"Were you called being a bondservant? Do not let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it."},{"content":"For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord's free man. Likewise he who was called being free is Messiah's bondservant."},{"content":"You were bought with a price. Do not become bondservants of men."},{"content":"Brothers, let each man, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with God."},{"content":"Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy."},{"content":"I think that it is good therefore, because of the distress that is on us, that it is good for a man to be as he is."},{"content":"Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife."},{"content":"But if you marry, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you."},{"content":"But I say this, brothers: the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none;"},{"content":"and those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess;"},{"content":"and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away."},{"content":"But I desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;"},{"content":"but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife."},{"content":"There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the worldï¿½how she may please her husband."},{"content":"This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction."},{"content":"But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He does not sin. Let them marry."},{"content":"But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep his own virgin, does well."},{"content":"So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage does better."},{"content":"A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whomever she desires, only in the Lord."},{"content":"But she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God's Spirit."}],[{"content":"Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."},{"content":"But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he does not yet know as he ought to know."},{"content":"But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him."},{"content":"Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no God but one."},{"content":"For though there are things that are called \"gods,\" whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many \"gods\" and many \"lords;\""},{"content":"yet to us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Messiah, through whom are all things, and we live through him."},{"content":"However, that knowledge is not in all men. But some, being so accustomed to idols until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled."},{"content":"But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we do not eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better."},{"content":"But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak."},{"content":"For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol's temple, won't his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?"},{"content":"And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whom the Messiah died."},{"content":"Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Messiah."},{"content":"Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I do not cause my brother to stumble."}],[{"content":"Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?"},{"content":"If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my office of apostle in the Lord."},{"content":"My defense to those who examine me is this."},{"content":"Have we no right to eat and to drink?"},{"content":"Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?"},{"content":"Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work?"},{"content":"What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and does not eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock, and does not drink from the flock's milk?"},{"content":"Do I speak these things according to the ways of men? Or does not the Law also say the same thing?"},{"content":"For it is written in the Law of Moses, \"You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.\" Is it for the oxen that God cares,"},{"content":"or does he say it assuredly for our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes in the hope of having a share."},{"content":"If we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things?"},{"content":"If others partake of this right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right, but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Messiah."},{"content":"Do you not know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple, and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar?"},{"content":"Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News."},{"content":"But I have used none of these things, and I do not write these things that it may be done so in my case; for I would rather die, than that anyone should make my boasting void."},{"content":"For if I proclaim the Good News, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me, if I do not proclaim the Good News."},{"content":"For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward. But if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me."},{"content":"What then is my reward? That, when I proclaim the Good News, I may present the Good News without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News."},{"content":"For though I was free from all, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more."},{"content":"To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law;"},{"content":"to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Messiah), that I might win those who are without law."},{"content":"To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some."},{"content":"Now I do all things for the sake of the Good News, that I may be a joint partaker of it."},{"content":"Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run like that, that you may win."},{"content":"Every man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things. Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible."},{"content":"I therefore run like that, as not uncertainly. I fight like that, as not beating the air,"},{"content":"but I beat my body and bring it into submission, lest by any means, after I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected."}],[{"content":"Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;"},{"content":"and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;"},{"content":"and all ate the same spiritual food;"},{"content":"and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Messiah."},{"content":"However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness."},{"content":"Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted."},{"content":"Neither be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, \"The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.\""},{"content":"Neither let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell."},{"content":"Neither let us test the Messiah, as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents."},{"content":"Neither grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer."},{"content":"Now all these things happened to them by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come."},{"content":"Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he does not fall."},{"content":"No temptation has taken you except what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it."},{"content":"Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry."},{"content":"I speak as to wise men. Judge what I say."},{"content":"The cup of blessing which we bless, is not it a sharing of the blood of Messiah? The bread which we break, is not it a sharing of the body of Messiah?"},{"content":"Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread."},{"content":"Consider Israel according to the flesh. Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?"},{"content":"What am I saying then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?"},{"content":"But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I do not desire that you would have fellowship with demons."},{"content":"You cannot both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot both partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons."},{"content":"Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?"},{"content":"\"All things are lawful,\" but not all things are profitable. \"All things are lawful,\" but not all things build up."},{"content":"Let no one seek his own, but his neighbor's good."},{"content":"Whatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience,"},{"content":"for \"the earth is the Lord's, and its fullness.\""},{"content":"But if one of those who do not believe invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience."},{"content":"But if anyone says to you, \"This was offered to idols,\" do not eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience."},{"content":"Conscience, I say, not your own, but the other's conscience. For why is my liberty judged by another conscience?"},{"content":"If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?"},{"content":"Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."},{"content":"Give no occasions for stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God;"},{"content":"even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved."}],[{"content":"Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Messiah."},{"content":"Now I praise you, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you."},{"content":"But I would have you know that the head of every man is Messiah, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Messiah is God."},{"content":"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head."},{"content":"But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head.
