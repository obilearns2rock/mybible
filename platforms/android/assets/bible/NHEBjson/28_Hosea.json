Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray, and they have been unfaithful to their God."},{"content":"They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because its shade is good. Therefore your daughters play the prostitute, and your brides commit adultery."},{"content":"I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute, nor your brides when they commit adultery; because the men consort with prostitutes, and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes; so the people without understanding will come to ruin."},{"content":"\"Though you, Israel, play the prostitute, yet do not let Judah offend; and do not come to Gilgal, neither go up to Beth Aven, nor swear, 'As the LORD lives.'"},{"content":"For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer. Then how will the LORD feed them like a lamb in a meadow."},{"content":"Ephraim is joined to idols. Leave him alone!"},{"content":"Their drink has become sour. They play the prostitute continually.

Your judgments are like a flash of lightning."},{"content":"For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings."},{"content":"But they, like Adam, have broken the covenant.

There is prostitution in Ephraim. Israel is defiled."},{"content":"\"Also, Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, when I restore the fortunes of my people."}],[{"content":"When I would heal Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered, also the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood, and the thief enters in, and the gang of robbers ravages outside."},{"content":"They do not consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness.

They assemble themselves for grain and new wine. They turn away from me."},{"content":"Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet they plot evil against me."},{"content":"They return, but not to the Most High. They are like a faulty bow. Their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue. This will be their derision in the land of Egypt."}],[{"content":"\"Put the trumpet to your lips!
