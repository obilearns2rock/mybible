The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests of the LORD, were there."},{"content":"When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:"},{"content":"but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but the LORD had shut up her womb."},{"content":"Her rival taunted her severely, to irritate her, because the LORD had shut up her womb."},{"content":"As he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she taunted her; therefore she wept, and did not eat."},{"content":"Elkanah her husband said to her, \"Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?\""},{"content":"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drank. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the LORD's temple."},{"content":"She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, and wept bitterly."},{"content":"She vowed a vow, and said, \"LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a boy, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head.\""},{"content":"It happened, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli saw her mouth."},{"content":"Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk."},{"content":"Eli said to her, \"How long will you make yourself drunk? Put away your wine from you.\""},{"content":"Hannah answered, \"No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before the LORD."},{"content":"Do not count your handmaid as a worthless woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my distress and my anguish.\""},{"content":"Then Eli answered, \"Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.\""},{"content":"She said, \"Let your handmaid find favor in your sight.\" So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression wasn't sad any more."},{"content":"They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her."},{"content":"It happened, when the time had come, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, saying, \"Because I have asked him of the LORD.\""},{"content":"The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow."},{"content":"But Hannah did not go up; for she said to her husband, \"Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and stay there forever.\""},{"content":"Elkanah her husband said to her, \"Do what seems good to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may the LORD establish his word.\" So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him."},{"content":"When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with a three year old bull, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the LORD's house in Shiloh. The child was young."},{"content":"They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli."},{"content":"She said, \"Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to the LORD."},{"content":"For this child I prayed; and the LORD has given me my petition which I asked of him."},{"content":"Therefore also I have granted him to the LORD. As long as he lives he is granted to the LORD.\" He worshiped the LORD there."}],[{"content":"Hannah prayed, and said: \"My heart exults in the LORD! My horn is exalted in the LORD. My mouth is enlarged over my enemies, because I rejoice in your salvation."},{"content":"There is no one as holy as the LORD, For there is no one besides you, nor is there any rock like our God."},{"content":"\"Talk no more so exceeding proudly. Do not let arrogance come out of your mouth, For the LORD is a God of knowledge. By him actions are weighed."},{"content":"\"The bows of the mighty men are broken. Those who stumbled are armed with strength."},{"content":"Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread. Those who were hungry are satisfied. Yes, the barren has borne seven.

He will give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.\""},{"content":"Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child served the LORD before Eli the priest."},{"content":"Now the sons of Eli were base men; they did not know the LORD."},{"content":"The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;"},{"content":"and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there."},{"content":"Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, \"Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw.\""},{"content":"If the man said to him, \"Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your soul desires\"; then he would say, \"No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force.\""},{"content":"The sin of the young men was very great before the LORD; for they despised the offering of the LORD."},{"content":"But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, clothed with a linen ephod."},{"content":"Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice."},{"content":"Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, \"The LORD give you seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of the LORD.\" They went to their own home."},{"content":"The LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew before the LORD."},{"content":"Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting."},{"content":"He said to them, \"Why do you do such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people."},{"content":"No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make the LORD's people disobey."},{"content":"If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him?\" Notwithstanding, they did not listen to the voice of their father, because the LORD intended to kill them."},{"content":"The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with the LORD, and also with men."},{"content":"A man of God came to Eli, and said to him, \"Thus says the LORD, I plainly revealed myself to the house of your father, when they were slaves in Egypt to the house of Pharaoh."},{"content":"And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me. And I gave to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire."},{"content":"Why do you kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?'"},{"content":"\"Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, says, 'I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever.' But now the LORD says, 'Be it far from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed."},{"content":"Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father's house, that there shall not be an old man in your house."},{"content":"You shall see the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which I shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever."},{"content":"The man of yours, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall consume your eyes, and grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age."},{"content":"\"'This shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall both die."},{"content":"I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed forever."},{"content":"It shall happen, that everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, \"Please put me into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.\"'\""}],[{"content":"The child Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. The word of the LORD was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision."},{"content":"It happened at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),"},{"content":"and the lamp of God hadn't yet gone out, and Samuel had lain down in the LORD's temple, where the ark of God was;"},{"content":"that the LORD called Samuel; and he said, \"Here I am.\""},{"content":"He ran to Eli, and said, \"Here I am; for you called me.\" He said, \"I did not call; lie down again.\" He went and lay down."},{"content":"The LORD called yet again, \"Samuel!\" Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, \"Here I am; for you called me.\" He answered, \"I did not call, my son; lie down again.\""},{"content":"Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed to him."},{"content":"The LORD called Samuel again the third time. He arose and went to Eli, and said, \"Here I am; for you called me.\" Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child."},{"content":"Therefore Eli said to Samuel, \"Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he calls you, that you shall say, 'Speak, LORD; for your servant hears.'\" So Samuel went and lay down in his place."},{"content":"The LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, \"Samuel! Samuel!\" Then Samuel said, \"Speak; for your servant hears.\""},{"content":"The LORD said to Samuel, \"Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle."},{"content":"In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end."},{"content":"For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and he did not restrain them."},{"content":"Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be removed with sacrifice nor offering forever.\""},{"content":"Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. Samuel feared to show Eli the vision."},{"content":"Then Eli called Samuel, and said, \"Samuel, my son!\" He said, \"Here I am.\""},{"content":"He said, \"What is the thing that he has spoken to you? Please do not hide it from me.
