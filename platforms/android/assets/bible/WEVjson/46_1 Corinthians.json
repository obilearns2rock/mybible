Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?"},{"content":"I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,"},{"content":"so that no one should say that I had baptized you into my own name."},{"content":"(I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don't know whether I baptized any other.)"},{"content":"For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Good News--not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ wouldn't be made void."},{"content":"For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the power of God."},{"content":"For it is written, \"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing.\""},{"content":"Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the lawyer of this world? Hasn't God made foolish the wisdom of this world?"},{"content":"For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom didn't know God, it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe."},{"content":"For Jews ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,"},{"content":"but we preach Christ crucified; a stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks,"},{"content":"but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God."},{"content":"Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men."},{"content":"For you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble;"},{"content":"but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise.

For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God."},{"content":"For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God's Spirit."},{"content":"But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God."},{"content":"Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things."},{"content":"Now the natural man doesn't receive the things of God's Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can't know them, because they are spiritually discerned."},{"content":"But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one."},{"content":"\"For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?\" But we have Christ's mind."}],[{"content":"Brothers, I couldn't speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ."},{"content":"I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren't yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,"},{"content":"for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren't you fleshly, and don't you walk in the ways of men?"},{"content":"For when one says, \"I follow Paul,\" and another, \"I follow Apollos,\" aren't you fleshly?"},{"content":"Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?"},{"content":"I planted. Apollos watered.

You are God's farming, God's building."},{"content":"According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it.

For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man's work is."},{"content":"If any man's work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward."},{"content":"If any man's work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire."},{"content":"Don't you know that you are a temple of God, and that God's Spirit lives in you?"},{"content":"If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God's temple is holy, which you are."},{"content":"Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise."},{"content":"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.

For all things are yours,"},{"content":"whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,"},{"content":"and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's."}],[{"content":"So let a man think of us as Christ's servants, and stewards of God's mysteries."},{"content":"Here, moreover, it is required of stewards, that they be found faithful."},{"content":"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by man's judgment. Yes, I don't judge my own self."},{"content":"For I know nothing against myself. Yet I am not justified by this, but he who judges me is the Lord."},{"content":"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each man will get his praise from God."},{"content":"Now these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written, that none of you be puffed up against one another."},{"content":"For who makes you different? And what do you have that you didn't receive? But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?"},{"content":"You are already filled. You have already become rich. You have come to reign without us. Yes, and I wish that you did reign, that we also might reign with you."},{"content":"For, I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death. For we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men."},{"content":"We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You have honor, but we have dishonor."},{"content":"Even to this present hour we hunger, thirst, are naked, are beaten, and have no certain dwelling place."},{"content":"We toil, working with our own hands. When people curse us, we bless. Being persecuted, we endure."},{"content":"Being defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, the dirt wiped off by all, even until now."},{"content":"I don't write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children."},{"content":"For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, I became your father through the Good News."},{"content":"I beg you therefore, be imitators of me."},{"content":"Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every assembly."},{"content":"Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you."},{"content":"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord is willing. And I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power."},{"content":"For the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power."},{"content":"What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?"}],[{"content":"It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father's wife."},{"content":"You are puffed up, and didn't rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you."},{"content":"For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing."},{"content":"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,"},{"content":"are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."},{"content":"Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?"},{"content":"Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place."},{"content":"Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."},{"content":"I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;"},{"content":"yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world."},{"content":"But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. Don't even eat with such a person."},{"content":"For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside? Don't you judge those who are within?"},{"content":"But those who are outside, God judges. \"Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.\""}],[{"content":"Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?"},{"content":"Don't you know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?"},{"content":"Don't you know that we will judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?"},{"content":"If then, you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly?"},{"content":"I say this to move you to shame. Isn't there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers?"},{"content":"But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers!"},{"content":"Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?"},{"content":"No, but you yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that against your brothers."},{"content":"Or don't you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don't be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals,"},{"content":"nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortioners, will inherit the Kingdom of God."},{"content":"Such were some of you, but you were washed. But you were sanctified. But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God."},{"content":"\"All things are lawful for me,\" but not all things are expedient. \"All things are lawful for me,\" but I will not be brought under the power of anything."},{"content":"\"Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods,\" but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body."},{"content":"Now God raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power."},{"content":"Don't you know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!"},{"content":"Or don't you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For, \"The two,\" says he, \"will become one flesh.\""},{"content":"But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."},{"content":"Flee sexual immorality! \"Every sin that a man does is outside the body,\" but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body."},{"content":"Or don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which you have from God? You are not your own,"},{"content":"for you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's."}],[{"content":"Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman."},{"content":"But, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband."},{"content":"Let the husband render to his wife the affection owed her, and likewise also the wife to her husband."},{"content":"The wife doesn't have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise also the husband doesn't have authority over his own body, but the wife."},{"content":"Don't deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn't tempt you because of your lack of self-control."},{"content":"But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment."},{"content":"Yet I wish that all men were like me. However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind."},{"content":"But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am."},{"content":"But if they don't have self-control, let them marry. For it's better to marry than to burn."},{"content":"But to the married I command--not I, but the Lord--that the wife not leave her husband"},{"content":"(but if she departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband not leave his wife."},{"content":"But to the rest I--not the Lord--say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let him not leave her."},{"content":"The woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content to live with her, let her not leave her husband."},{"content":"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy."},{"content":"Yet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us in peace."},{"content":"For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?"},{"content":"Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk. So I command in all the assemblies."},{"content":"Was anyone called having been circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised."},{"content":"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."},{"content":"Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called."},{"content":"Were you called being a bondservant? Don't let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it."},{"content":"For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord's free man. Likewise he who was called being free is Christ's bondservant."},{"content":"You were bought with a price. Don't become bondservants of men."},{"content":"Brothers, let each man, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with God."},{"content":"Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy."},{"content":"I think that it is good therefore, because of the distress that is on us, that it is good for a man to be as he is."},{"content":"Are you bound to a wife? Don't seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife? Don't seek a wife."},{"content":"But if you marry, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you."},{"content":"But I say this, brothers: the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none;"},{"content":"and those who weep, as though they didn't weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didn't rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn't possess;"},{"content":"and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away."},{"content":"But I desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;"},{"content":"but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife."},{"content":"There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world--how she may please her husband."},{"content":"This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction."},{"content":"But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He doesn't sin. Let them marry."},{"content":"But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep his own virgin, does well."},{"content":"So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn't give her in marriage does better."},{"content":"A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whoever she desires, only in the Lord."},{"content":"But she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God's Spirit."}],[{"content":"Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."},{"content":"But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn't yet know as he ought to know."},{"content":"But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him."},{"content":"Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one."},{"content":"For though there are things that are called \"gods,\" whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many \"gods\" and many \"lords;\""},{"content":"yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him."},{"content":"However, that knowledge isn't in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled."},{"content":"But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don't eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better."},{"content":"But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak."},{"content":"For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol's temple, won't his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?"},{"content":"And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died."},{"content":"Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ."},{"content":"Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I don't cause my brother to stumble."}],[{"content":"Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Haven't I seen Jesus Christ, our Lord? Aren't you my work in the Lord?"},{"content":"If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord."},{"content":"My defense to those who examine me is this."},{"content":"Have we no right to eat and to drink?"},{"content":"Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?"},{"content":"Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work?"},{"content":"What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and doesn't eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock, and doesn't drink from the flock's milk?"},{"content":"Do I speak these things according to the ways of men? Or doesn't the law also say the same thing?"},{"content":"For it is written in the law of Moses, \"You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.\" Is it for the oxen that God cares,"},{"content":"or does he say it assuredly for our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope."},{"content":"If we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things?"},{"content":"If others partake of this right over you, don't we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right, but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ."},{"content":"Don't you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple, and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar?"},{"content":"Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News."},{"content":"But I have used none of these things, and I don't write these things that it may be done so in my case; for I would rather die, than that anyone should make my boasting void."},{"content":"For if I preach the Good News, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me, if I don't preach the Good News."},{"content":"For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward. But if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me."},{"content":"What then is my reward? That, when I preach the Good News, I may present the Good News of Christ without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News."},{"content":"For though I was free from all, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more."},{"content":"To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law;"},{"content":"to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law."},{"content":"To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some."},{"content":"Now I do this for the sake of the Good News, that I may be a joint partaker of it."},{"content":"Don't you know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run like that, that you may win."},{"content":"Every man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things. Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible."},{"content":"I therefore run like that, as not uncertainly. I fight like that, as not beating the air,"},{"content":"but I beat my body and bring it into submission, lest by any means, after I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected."}],[{"content":"Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;"},{"content":"and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;"},{"content":"and all ate the same spiritual food;"},{"content":"and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ."},{"content":"However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness."},{"content":"Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted."},{"content":"Neither be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, \"The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.\""},{"content":"Neither let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell."},{"content":"Neither let us test the Lord, as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents."},{"content":"Neither grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer."},{"content":"Now all these things happened to them by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come."},{"content":"Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesn't fall."},{"content":"No temptation has taken you except what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it."},{"content":"Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry."},{"content":"I speak as to wise men. Judge what I say."},{"content":"The cup of blessing which we bless, isn't it a sharing of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, isn't it a sharing of the body of Christ?"},{"content":"Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread."},{"content":"Consider Israel according to the flesh. Don't those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?"},{"content":"What am I saying then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?"},{"content":"But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I don't desire that you would have fellowship with demons."},{"content":"You can't both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can't both partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons."},{"content":"Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?"},{"content":"\"All things are lawful for me,\" but not all things are profitable. \"All things are lawful for me,\" but not all things build up."},{"content":"Let no one seek his own, but each one his neighbor's good."},{"content":"Whatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience,"},{"content":"for \"the earth is the Lord's, and its fullness.\""},{"content":"But if one of those who don't believe invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience."},{"content":"But if anyone says to you, \"This was offered to idols,\" don't eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience. For \"the earth is the Lord's, and all its fullness.\""},{"content":"Conscience, I say, not your own, but the other's conscience. For why is my liberty judged by another conscience?"},{"content":"If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?"},{"content":"Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."},{"content":"Give no occasions for stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the assembly of God;"},{"content":"even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved."}],[{"content":"Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ."},{"content":"Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you."},{"content":"But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God."},{"content":"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head."},{"content":"But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head.
