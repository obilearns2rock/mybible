The trumpets sounded as they went."},{"content":"Joshua commanded the people, saying, \"You shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout.

It happened, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city."},{"content":"They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword."},{"content":"Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, \"Go into the prostitute's house, and bring out from there the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her.\""},{"content":"The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. They also brought out all her relatives, and they set them outside of the camp of Israel."},{"content":"They burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh's house."},{"content":"But Rahab the prostitute, her father's household, and all that she had, Joshua saved alive. She lived in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho."},{"content":"Joshua commanded them with an oath at that time, saying, \"Cursed is the man before Yahweh, who rises up and builds this city Jericho. With the loss of his firstborn shall he lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up its gates.\""},{"content":"So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land."}],[{"content":"But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things.

Don't make all the people to toil there, for there are only a few of them.\""},{"content":"So about three thousand men of the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai."},{"content":"The men of Ai struck about thirty-six men of them, and they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck them at the descent. The hearts of the people melted, and became like water."},{"content":"Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads."},{"content":"Joshua said, \"Alas, Lord Yahweh, why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? I wish that we had been content and lived beyond the Jordan!"},{"content":"Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!"},{"content":"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. What will you do for your great name?\""},{"content":"Yahweh said to Joshua, \"Get up! Why are you fallen on your face like that?"},{"content":"Israel has sinned. Yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. Yes, they have even taken of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and also deceived. They have even put it among their own stuff."},{"content":"Therefore the children of Israel can't stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction. I will not be with you any more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you."},{"content":"\"Get up! Sanctify the people, and say, 'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, \"There is a devoted thing in the midst of you, Israel.

Tell me now what you have done!

Behold, they are hidden in the ground in the middle of my tent, with the silver under it.\""},{"content":"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. Behold, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under it."},{"content":"They took them from the middle of the tent, and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel. They laid them down before Yahweh."},{"content":"Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his cattle, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor."},{"content":"Joshua said, \"Why have you troubled us? Yahweh will trouble you this day.\" All Israel stoned him with stones, and they burned them with fire and stoned them with stones."},{"content":"They raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Yahweh turned from the fierceness of his anger.

It shall happen, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them."},{"content":"They will come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, 'They flee before us, like the first time.' So we will flee before them,"},{"content":"and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city; for Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand."},{"content":"It shall be, when you have seized on the city, that you shall set the city on fire.

Now there was a valley between him and Ai."},{"content":"He took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city."},{"content":"So they set the people, even all the army who was on the north of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley."},{"content":"It happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he didn't know that there was an ambush against him behind the city."},{"content":"Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness."},{"content":"All the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them. They pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city."},{"content":"There was not a man left in Ai or Beth El who didn't go out after Israel. They left the city open, and pursued Israel."},{"content":"Yahweh said to Joshua, \"Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.\" Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city."},{"content":"The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it. They hurried and set the city on fire."},{"content":"When the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way.
